                            <strong>Gathering Requirements (#1)</strong><br>
                            Successfully modified the customer frontend based on a single client's needs and began establishing admin frontend requirements. Documented prototype versions and reasons for design decisions to align with stakeholder input.

                            <strong>Enhanced Security (#5)</strong><br>
                            While the application maintains basic security, there is a need for a more comprehensive approach to API call protection and advanced authorization checks. Future updates will include robust security measures to fully align with outcome #5.

                      <strong>Algorithmic Solutions (3)</strong><br>
                      Refactored the application’s frontend model and controller patterns, as well as the API model hierarchy, to streamline CRUD operations and improve data delivery mechanisms. This overhaul significantly simplified algorithms for handling page objects and Frontend Express Components (FECs).

                    <li>
                      <strong>Innovative Computing (4)</strong><br>
                      Created and leveraged a “base model” and “page model” to enable dynamic page rendering. This approach not only supports modular and DRY code practices, but also allows the Express site to generate pages based on a single document, minimizing the need for manual controller logic.

                      <strong>Security Mindset (5)</strong><br>
                      Although the groundwork for role-based authorization was laid, full integration of security measures remains incomplete. Plans include enhancing API protections and incorporating robust route security, ensuring only minimal, relevant data is shared with authorized roles.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Deeper Admin Frontend Integration</strong><br>
                      While the admin solution evolved during this enhancement, additional improvements—such as more seamless form updating and an earlier discovery of optimal data flow—will be pursued in the next iteration.

                      <strong>Algorithmic Solutions (3)</strong><br>
                      Consolidated the application's routes under <code>.route('/components/:componentType/:id')</code>, streamlining data flow and reducing redundant logic, which allowed the Angular and Express sites to load page elements dynamically.

                      Employed new techniques in user roles and RBAC to deliver scalable, secure solutions. By centralizing component logic in a single route, the application further supports future feature expansions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Security Mindset (5)</strong><br>
                      Implemented robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and JWT-based user roles, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure. The system now filters data at the API level based on user privileges, preventing unauthorized access.

                      While the core security and data structure goals were met, further refactoring is needed to maintain clarity, including database models for storing roles and granular page access.

                      <strong>Incomplete Image Select Tool</strong><br>
                      The final milestone for full editability remains unfinished. Completing this feature will allow all Front-End Components (FECs) to be edited via the Angular frontend, maximizing the programmatic approach to page generation.
